## Codewar Katas

This repo is to consolidate my learning/practice on different programming languages.  


I can so much relate to this statement now: **"Once you have completed a kata you can see how others have done it, giving you insights into alternative ways of solving programming problems..."** 

The link to codewars van be found [here](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard).
